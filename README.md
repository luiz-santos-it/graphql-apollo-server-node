# GraphQL Server Example

This is a simple GraphQL server example using Apollo Server and TypeScript.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Docker

### Installation

#### Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd graphql-server-example
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server (this will also generate GraphQL types, compile TypeScript files, and copy the schema file):
   ```sh
   npm run start
   ```

#### Using Docker

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t graphql-server-example .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 4000:4000 graphql-server-example
   ```

### Usage

Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL Playground at `http://localhost:4000` to interact with the GraphQL API.
